I am a masters Student at IIT Hyderbad. I am currently supervised
by Vineeth Balasubramaniam. My research intrest include but are not
limited to 

 * Optimisation methods
 * Reinforcement learning 
 * Deep bayesian methods. 

I am presently working 2 problems.
1. Graph Embeddings using non-spectal graph methods.
2. Online Batch selection for better generalisation and faster convergence of NN.

I also enjoy fiction reading when i get the time. I would want to travel around the
world some day.
